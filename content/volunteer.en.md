# Start Gaining: Become a CoderDojo Mentor

Volunteering at CoderDojo is an **investment in yourself.** It energizes you, builds your skills, gives you a sense of purpose — and along the way, you inspire future innovators. Think of it as **ALT+F4 for burnout.**

## Why Become a Volunteer?

### Personal Growth
- **Develop leadership skills:** Learn how to explain complex ideas — a perfect foundation for managing teams or clients.  
- **"Learn again":** Refresh your basics in Python or Scratch, or discover Raspberry Pi alongside the kids.  
- **Confidence and communication:** Practice public speaking in a relaxed, friendly environment — a great way to start.  
- **Authentic networking:** Meet people driven by passion, **not KPIs.** Build a network of professionals who care.  
- **Gain valuable experience** in leadership and project management.  
- **Step toward leadership:** Gain *practical* mentoring and organizational experience that makes your CV stand out.  
- **Satisfaction and well-being:** Reconnect with purpose, reduce stress, and counter burnout through meaningful action.  

### Community Impact (the side effect)
- **Inspire the next generation** of developers and tech innovators.  
- **Equalize opportunities:** Provide free, inclusive education that can change a child’s life trajectory.  
- **Build lasting relationships** with other mentors and volunteers.  
- **Contribute to a more diverse and inclusive tech community.**

## What We’re Looking For

### Essential Qualities
- **Curiosity and willingness to experiment!** You don’t need to know every programming language. If you can use Google and enjoy finding solutions together with kids — you’re ready.  
- A good attitude and the ability to simply **“Be Cool!”** (our only rule).  

### Nice to Have
- Some background in IT or engineering (even as a junior).  
- **A few free hours:** You can volunteer just a few weekends per year — there’s no strict, long-term commitment required.
