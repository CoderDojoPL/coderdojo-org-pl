{{< lead >}}
CoderDojo is a community of people who want to share their passion for technology. We create clubs where children and youth learn programming, electronics, games, or robotics – completely free, in an atmosphere of fun and joy.

**We also do it for ourselves** – because volunteering develops us, gives us a sense of purpose, and builds relationships. At CoderDojo, you don't need to be an expert or a teacher. You just need to want to get involved.
