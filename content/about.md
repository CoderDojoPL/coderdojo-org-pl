# About CoderDojo Poland

Welcome to CoderDojo Poland, a tribute to one of the most impactful educational initiatives in Polish tech history.

## Our Mission

CoderDojo Poland operates with a clear purpose:

- **Promote volunteering** as a meaningful and empowering activity
- **Preserve and showcase** the legacy of the CoderDojo Poland initiative (2013–2020)
- **Provide a landing page** and onboarding flow for potential mentors
- **Inspire the next generation** of coding educators and volunteers

## What is CoderDojo?

CoderDojo is a global movement of free, volunteer-led, community-based programming clubs for young people. Anyone aged seven to seventeen can visit a Dojo where they can learn to code, build websites, create apps or games, and explore technology in an informal, creative, and social environment.

## Our Legacy

From 2013 to 2020, CoderDojo Poland brought together hundreds of volunteers and thousands of young learners across the country. Our initiative demonstrated the power of community-driven education and the impact that dedicated volunteers can have on young minds.

## Why Volunteering Matters

Volunteering is more than just giving back—it's about:

- **Personal growth** and skill development
- **Building connections** within the tech community
- **Making a lasting impact** on young people's lives
- **Creating positive change** in your local community
