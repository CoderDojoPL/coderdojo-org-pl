# The Legacy of CoderDojo Poland (2013–2020)

CoderDojo is a global movement of free, volunteer-led community coding clubs for young people. Anyone could visit a Dojo to learn coding, web development, app and game design, or simply explore technology in an informal, creative, and social environment. In Poland, CoderDojo grew rapidly from 2013 onward, building a network of over 20 local clubs — from Zambrów to Warsaw and Wrocław. Our Dojos, organized in IT companies, libraries, and community centers, became spaces where kids learned Scratch, robotics, and 3D printing, while adults formed **strong professional connections**.

## Origins and Once-Real Numbers

* **Beginning:** The initiative started in **Zambrów** in 2013 as a direct response to the global, non-profit CoderDojo movement.  
* **Community Size:** At its peak, the Foundation gathered **over 100 volunteer mentors** across **22 active Dojos** in Poland.  
* **Weekly Reach:** Around **450 children and teens per week** learned programming, robotics, and 3D printing in a relaxed, non-commercial atmosphere.  
* **Integration:** We organized national **SuperDojo** gatherings, attracting over 350 participants — kids, parents, and mentors alike.

### Key Achievements and Partnerships

Our work went far beyond running clubs. CoderDojo Poland became a **laboratory of social innovation in technology education**, linking grassroots volunteering with systemic and institutional impact.

* **Strategic Partnership:** We were one of the key partners of **Samsung’s “Masters of Coding”** — at the time, Poland’s largest coding education initiative, reaching thousands of teachers and students. CoderDojo contributed the social component: mentoring and open, volunteer-based teaching methods.  
* **Impact on the Education System:** Our methods and materials (lesson plans, mentor handbooks) informed the development of Poland’s new programming curriculum. We demonstrated that learning to code can be *informal, joyful, and community-driven* — not just another school subject.  
* **EdTech Ecosystem Development:** We supported educational startups — from early concept consultations to product testing. Among our partners was the team behind **Photon**, an educational robot that became a symbol of Polish EdTech.  
* **Global Recognition:** Our young participants (Ninjas) represented Poland at international **Coolest Projects Awards** events in Ireland, earning prizes and distinctions. Their success proved that local Dojos can nurture globally capable talent.  
* **Social Capital and Local Empowerment:** Through **T-Mobile’s “Fajne Granty”** program, co-led with the Ministry of Digital Affairs, we supported **47 local digital education initiatives**. CoderDojo mentors became local tech leaders — organizing events, hackathons, and mini-conferences.  
* **The Multiplication Effect:** Many volunteers went on to create their own initiatives, coding schools, and mentoring programs. The influence of CoderDojo can still be seen in companies, NGOs, and universities that continue this culture of openness and collaboration.

> The legacy of CoderDojo Poland isn’t just about numbers or awards — it’s about **changing how Poland learns technology**: from hierarchical to collaborative, from consumer to creator.

## The Model We Promoted: Authentic Volunteering

What made CoderDojo stand out was its **culture**. That’s why the Foundation is worth reviving — this model worked, developing not only children but adults too.

* **Iron Rule: free, non-profit mission.** No one received payment for mentoring or running key Foundation activities. This built authentic trust and a true community of enthusiasts.  
* **The Anti-School:** We rejected formality. No attendance lists, no grades, no rigid scripts. Participants worked at their own pace, guided by mentors and driven by **autonomy**.  
* **Volunteer Benefits:** For mentors, involvement in CoderDojo was:  
    * **An Investment in Themselves:** growth of soft skills (explaining complex ideas), networking.  
    * **An Emotional Gain:** sense of purpose, burnout prevention, and deep satisfaction.  

## Our People and Their Successes

### Achievements of Alumni (Our Ninjas)

The young people who grew up in CoderDojo continue their journeys in technology:  
* Studying computer science at top universities.  
* Interning at leading tech companies.  
* Launching startups and contributing to open-source projects.  

### Mentor Growth

Volunteers also gained significantly — applying their CoderDojo experience in their careers:  
* Career advancement and leadership roles (thanks to mentoring and club management experience).  
* Speaking opportunities at conferences and launching new educational initiatives.  
* Building a **network of peers** connected by passion rather than corporate goals.  

## The Legacy Lives On: Returning to the Mission

Although challenges such as COVID-19 brought the Foundation to the brink of closure in 2024, its legacy and model are too valuable to disappear.

**Our new mission** shifts the focus from *educating children* to *supporting volunteers*. We aim to preserve the **Win-Win Volunteering** model — one that develops skills, builds relationships, and gives meaning to those who give their time.
